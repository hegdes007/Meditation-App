        <p class=""> <b>T</b>he French philosopher Michel de Montaigne is quoted as having once said ‘<em>The greatest thing in the world is to know how to belong to oneself.</em>’ Never is this truer in our current, fast-paced society.</p> 
        <p>With so many demands on our time and minds, it takes conscious effort to take a moment and allow ourselves the time we need to explore who we truly are. Even when we do make time, many people are stuck on how to actually do this. The practice of meditation has certainly been recognized as a key method that can help.</p>
        <p class="">The word meditation stems from <em>meditatum</em>, a Latin term that means ‘to ponder.’ Through the practice of meditation, we can seek to find a better connection with our body in the everyday moments that we often let pass us by, and create stronger awareness for how our emotions influence our behavior (West, 2016).</p>
        <p>You may already have a meditation practice that works for you, or you may be new to the concept and looking to build your knowledge and understanding of how meditation can bring value to your daily life. Either way, the history of meditation is fascinating and well worth exploring.</p>

        <h2>How Old is Meditation?</h2>
        <p>The answer to that question is more complex than you might think. Different research, books, and schools of meditation refer to the ‘age-old tradition’, but as to how long meditation has been around as practice really depends on your definition of the concept.</p>
        <p>Davanger (2008) reviewed a cross-section of research looking at meditation and speculated that the practice might be as old as humanity itself with the potential meditative capacities of Neanderthals. There are more schools of thought that have placed the origin of meditation within a structured set of practices and techniques based on artifacts and references in Eastern countries.</p>
        <p>Below are the main two, and how far they date back.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>India</strong> – In some of the oldest written records from around 1500 BCE in India, the practice of <em>Dhyāna</em> or <em>Jhāna</em> is referenced as the training of the mind, often translated as meditation. Many of these records come from the Hindu traditions of Vedantism and discuss the various meditation practices across ancient India. Buddhist Indian scriptures and texts dating back to only a few hundred BC are even earlier recordings of the practice, but many argue that these are somewhat ambiguous in their references directly to meditation.</li>
        <div class="images">
          <img src="./dhyana-removebg-preview.png" alt="Swami Vivekananda">
        </div>
        <li><strong>China</strong> – Early forms of meditation are referenced as far back as the 3rd and 6th century BC and linked to the Daoist, Laozi, an ancient Chinese philosopher, and his writings. In this work, many of the terms used in later centuries to describe <a href="https://positivepsychology.com/meditation-techniques-beginners/">meditation techniques</a> are used, including:
      <ul>
        <li>Shou Zhong – roughly translated as ‘guarding the middle’</li>
        <li>Bao Yi – roughly translated as ‘embracing the one’</li>
        <li>Shou Jing – roughly translated as ‘guarding tranquility’</li>
        <li>Bao Pu – roughly translated as ‘embracing simplicity’</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>However, some argue that it is difficult to tell if these were already widely used techniques when the text was written, or if they were newly created terms for the text. Other writings from the early centuries that describe meditative practices include the <em>Zhuangzi</em> from the late Warring States period, roughly 476–221 BC, and the <em>Neiye</em> from the 4th century BC.</p>
      <p>The truth is, no one knows for absolute certain when meditation officially started. There are multiple references across different cultures and religions – including Judaism, Islam, and Christianity – to meditative-like practices, which all seem to have contributed to and inform the practice known widely today.</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Where Did Meditation Originate?</h2>
      <p>Much like pinning down how long meditation has been around for, pinpointing where exactly it originates is equally tricky.</p>
      p>The earliest written records come from Hindu traditions, in India, of Vendatism from around 1500 BCE. Vendatism is a school of philosophy and is one of the earliest known Indian paths for spiritual enlightenment. Other forms of meditation are then cited around the 6th and 5th centuries BCE within Taoist China and Buddhist India.</p>
      <p>The precise origins are heavily debated, especially around Buddhist meditation (Wynne, 2007). Some early written accounts of the different states of meditation in Buddhism in India can be found in the sutras of the Pāli Canon, which dates back to the 1st century BCE. The Pāli Canon is a collection of scriptures from the Theravada Buddhist tradition.</p>
      p>Some evidence has also connected meditative practices with Judaism, thought to be inherited from its earlier traditions. The Torah (the first five books of the Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible) contains a description of the patriarch Isaac going to ‘lasuach’ in a field. This term is generally understood as being some form of meditation (Kaplan, 1985).</p>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <h2>Do We Know Who Created/Invented Meditation?</h2>
      <p>In a nutshell, no we don’t. Because the where and when are quite hazy, discovering the who is equally ambiguous. Some of what we do know, however, indicates a few core people who have been instrumental in spreading the practice of meditation. Below I’ve outlined three of the key people, but there are many others who were equally prominent in sharing and spreading the practice of meditation.</p>
      <h3>The Buddha (India)</h3>
      <p>The Buddha, known by other names including Siddhārtha Gautama in Sanskrit or Siddhattha Gotama in Pali, was a prince who became a monk, sage, philosopher and religious leader. It is his teachings on which Buddhism was founded.</p>
      <p>Because of this, it might be easy to assume that the Buddha created or invented meditation but this is not true. Buddhism texts refer to many different practices of meditation and the Buddha sought out other enlightened teachers to learn the practice and ways of self-fulfillment from. Although he was instrumental in spreading the value of meditation as a practice, the Buddha himself did not invent it.</p>
      <h3>Lao-Tze (China)</h3>
      <p>Lao-Tze, also known by Lao-Tzu and Laozi, was an ancient Chinese philosopher whose name is essentially an honor title meaning ‘Old Teacher’ or ‘Old Master’.</p>
      <p>He is credited as the author of the Tao-te-Ching, a work of text that exemplifies his thoughts and teachings that founded the philosophical system of Taoism, which references meditative practices and the idea of wisdom in silence. There is much speculation as to whether Lao-Tze actually existed as a single man, or whether the name refers to a collection of individuals and philosophers who shared the same ideas.</p>
      <h3>Dosho (Japan)</h3>
      <p>Dosho was a Japanese monk who, in the 7th century, traveled to China and studied Buddhism under Hsuan Tsang, a great master at the time. It was during this journey that Dosho learned all about the process of Zen, which he then returned to Japan with.</p>
      <p>When he returned, he opened his first meditation hall dedicated to the practice of Zazen, a sitting meditation. He created a community of monks and students with a primary focus on teaching this form of meditation in Japan.</p>

      <h2>The Beginnings of Mindfulness Meditation</h2>
      <p>Much like meditation, the historical and ancient roots of mindfulness can be traced all over the world, and are heavily mixed with various religious beginnings.</p>
      <p>Mindfulness as a form of meditation has been traced back to Hinduism, around 1500 BCE, and is heavily connected with the practice of yoga.</p>
      <p><strong><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/benefits-of-yoga/">Yoga</a></strong> in its more ancient roots involved very little reference to movement or postures and placed a greater emphasis on stillness, a focus on breathing, and being present with the body at that moment. Mindfulness in this context has also been traced back to Buddhism and Daoism, both of which include a strong focus on breathing and self-awareness.</p>
      <p>Many religions include a form of prayer or meditation technique that sees the individual turning their thoughts away from everyday anxieties in search of greater self-awareness and presence in appreciating a greater perspective about life and their religion. This form of meditation is very closely aligned with the practice and purpose of <strong><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/what-is-mindfulness/">mindfulness</a>.</strong></p>
      <p>Around 40 years ago mindfulness became more prevalent in Western cultures. Jon Kabat-Zinn is often credited with being the founder of ‘modern day’ mindfulness, and the idea and concept of mindfulness that is commonly held across western cultures.</p>
      <p>In the 1970s Kabat-Zinn founded the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical school, and since then the school has helped to train and educated more than 18,000 people in the principles of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) – a clinically proven program to help support individuals experiencing a range of conditions including depression, anxiety, insomnia, chronic pain, and cardiovascular problems.</p>
      <p>Williams, Teasdale, and Seagal (1995) furthered the work of Kabat-Zinn by combining the <strong><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/mindfulness-based-stress-reduction-mbsr/">MBSR</a></strong> with Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (<strong><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/15-positive-cbt-tools-adfs/">CBT</a></strong>) to create the Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (<strong><a href="https://positivepsychology.com/mbct-mindfulness-based-cognitive-therapy/">MBCT</a></strong>) program.</p>
      <p>The program is clinically approved in the UK and is commonly used within clinical psychology to help treat individuals with a range of disorders including personality disorders, chronic pain, emotion regulation, and depression.</p>

      <h2>A Look at the History of Meditation Research</h2>
      <p>As meditation has grown in popularity, so has its interest within the research and psychology communities. The first piece of scientific research on meditation occurred in 1936, and in 1955 the first study using an electroencephalogram (EEG) occurred (Feuerstein, 2014). An EEG records electrical waves of activity in the brain by using electrodes placed across an individual’s head.</p>
      <p>In the 1960s, some of the first Western research took place at the Menninger Clinic in Kansas, United States, with Swami Rama, a senior Yogi from the Himalayan International Institute of Yoga Science. The studies were led by an American psychologist called Gardner Murphy and specifically focused on investigating Swami Rama’s abilities to control different bodily functions that were previously thought completely involuntary, such as his heartbeat and blood pressure (Feuerstein, 2018).</p>
      <p>Through the studies, Swami Rama also demonstrated the ability to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Produce different types of brain waves on demand – alpha, delta, theta, and gamma</li>
        <li>The ability to alter his heartbeat radically, including increasing it to 300 beats per minute for 16 seconds and completely stopping it from beating for a few seconds</li>
        <li>The ability to remain conscious of the surrounding environment while his brain was in the deep sleep cycle</li>
        <li>The ability to control his skin and internal body temperature</li>
      </ul>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The findings from these studies stimulated further interest across the psychological and medical communities to explore the physiological effects of meditation. Benson, Greenwood, and Klemchuk (1975) examined the effectiveness of meditation to support positive healthcare initiatives.</p>
      <p>Through his research, he reported that meditation produces a number of physical and biochemical changes within the body, which he collectively called the ‘Relaxation Response’. This was revolutionary at the time as previously meditation was thought of as a religious practice, and therefore not appropriate for medical or health purposes.</p>
      <p>Benson’s research began to change this opinion and continued the need for further research to fully understand the implications of meditative practice for healthcare.</p>
      <p>More researchers and psychologists continued to carry out studies looking at the effects of meditation on the mind and body, with a particular focus on addiction, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive functioning (Funderburk, 1977, Brown, Forte &amp; Dysart, 1984, Hayes, Strosahl &amp; Wilson, 1999, and Carter &amp; Ernst, 2003).</p>
      <p>Although the body of research has grown, there have in more recent years been concerns around the validity of blanketing some of the findings, with peer-reviewed, a meta-analysis of research finding that many of the research results are inconclusive.</p>
      <p>In 2000, the Dalai Lama met with psychologists and neuroscientists from Western backgrounds in India, to push the study of accomplished meditation masters with advanced neuroimaging technology and further explore the impact of meditation on the brain.</p>
      <p>The National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health published one such review in 2007. In their report, the researchers reviewed 813 different studies that examined five different categories of meditation: mantra meditation, mindfulness meditation, T’ai Chi, Qigong, and yoga.</p>
      <p>They focused on studies involving adults, and those that specifically looked at the effects of meditation on physiological conditions such as cardiovascular disease, substance abuse, addiction, and hypertension. From the review, the researchers concluded that there is a lack of quality methodology across studies pertaining to meditation and that there appeared to be no common theoretical perspective across scientific research.</p>
      <p>Although the quality of the research has certainly improved since the 1960s and 1970s when it first began, the researchers in this review argued that there is still work to be done.</p>
